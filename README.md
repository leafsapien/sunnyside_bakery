This website was created for a T@fe Qld Assignment.  It met its minimal criteria, such as: 
  - be 3 pages,
  - have a logo and banner on each page,
  - have a photos page with 3 images,
  - have a contact page that includes a table,
  - display image editing abilities by blurring and rotating several images,
  - navigation functions as intended.

Please forgive its rudimental nature, it was completed in haste to meet minimum requirements.
